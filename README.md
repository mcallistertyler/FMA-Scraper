# FMA-Scraper
Scrapes the FMA using a pretty hacky method, works nonetheless.
Based mostly on the method described here https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1prnu9/guide_ripping_the_free_music_archive/

Needs both Python2 and 3 because it uses some old code from https://github.com/samwize/pyExtractor and I'm too lazy to change it.
